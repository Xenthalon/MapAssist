# Item filter rules
# "Any" can be used if you would like to see ALL uniques, all set items, all items with x sockets, etc
# Most of the time we don't want to filter that broadly, so this is commented out with #
# Any:
# - Qualities: [unique, magic]

# The first line or "Key" is the item base type, in the next case, "Harlequin Crest" is a unique "Shako"
# Alert to any unique Shako, regardless of any other criteria (sockets, eth)
Shako:                              # Item Base Type
  - Qualities: unique               # Rule starts with "-" and lists one of 3 criteria

# Criteria options are:
#   Ethereal: (true/false)
#   Sockets: [0 - 6]
#   Qualities: [inferior, normal, superior, magic, set, rare, unique, crafted]
#   Defense: (number)
#   Strength: (number)
#   Dexterity: (number)
#   Vitality: (number)

# Additional criteria can be listed below the first. Do not prefix a "-" to lines with criteria you wish to include
# as part of the same rule. You can also list multiple values for both Qualities and Sockets as shown in the Thresher
# example below
#
# This thresher rule is really 2 separate rules. One with 3 criteria and one with a single criteria.
# The first rule will look for only ethereal threshers with 0 or 4 sockets that are either normal or superior quality
# The second rule looks only for unique threshers. The criteria listed for the first rule do not apply to the second
# Therefore, the second rule will log any unique thresher, with any number of sockets

# Listing multiple values
# Another way to list multiple values for Qualities and Sockets is to list each desired quality or number of sockets
# on its own line with an extra indent and a "-"
# This format is supported but its use is discouraged

# Because Ethereal: true is not set here, both non-ethereal and ethereal items will trigger this rule
